        "Welcome to the second assignment of Week 2. You are going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier. \n",
        "\n",
        "Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. \n",
        "So rather than writing:\n",
        ">\"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!\"   \n",
        "\n",
        "The emojifier can automatically turn this into:\n",
        ">\"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as \"Let's go see the baseball game tonight!\") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using word vectors to improve emoji lookups\n",
        "* In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ‚ù§Ô∏è is the \"heart\" symbol rather than the \"love\" symbol. \n",
        "    * In other words, you'll have to remember to type \"heart\" to find the desired emoji, and typing \"love\" won't bring up that symbol.\n",
        "* We can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!\n",
        "* When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.\n",
        "    * This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set. \n",
        "    * This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### What you'll build\n",
        "1. In this exercise, you'll start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings.\n",
        "2. Then you will build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM. "

        "##### Example of padding\n",
        "* Given a maximum sequence length of 20, we could pad every sentence with \"0\"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. \n",
        "* Thus, the sentence \"I love you\" would be represented as $(e_{I}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \\vec{0}, \\vec{0}, \\ldots, \\vec{0})$. \n",
        "* In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. \n",
